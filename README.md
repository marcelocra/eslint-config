# My eslint + prettier config

This repo should contain all eslint and prettier settings that I use most of the
time.

## Notes

- This repo has a top level prettierrc, used to format non-js files here.
- This repo has a top level eslintrc, used to fix js files here based on one of
  the settings we defined.

## Acknowledgement

This is essentially a fork from
[Rocketseat eslint config](https://github.com/Rocketseat/eslint-config-rocketseat/).

I planned to use a different structure, which is why it is not actually a fork,
but ended up not doing so, at least not for now.
